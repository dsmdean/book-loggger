Project created during the course "AngularJS Services In-depth" on Pluralsight.


Description of the course:
Services are a major piece of every AngularJS application and will likely make up the majority of the code you write in your own apps. Creating your own services requires understanding the different types of services and how and why to use each of them. The framework also provides lots of built-in services that can help you manage network requests, asynchronous execution, routing, and much more. Taking full advantage of that functionality requires a deep understanding of what is possible and how to use it to fit your particular situation. This course will teach you all of these things so you can build great applications with Google's popular framework.
